### Best Practices for Screenshot Capture

- **Minimize Glare**: Position your character to reduce screen glare, or try a different terminal with better lighting.
- **Align Closely**: Stand as close and straight to the terminal as possible for maximum clarity.
- **Disable Hints**: Turn off in-game hints (Options > Game Settings > Show Hints, Control Hints) to avoid text overlap.
- **Avoid Overlays**: Ensure `r_DisplayInfo` or other overlays do not obscure the commodity list.
- **Scroll Carefully**: When scrolling, ensure the first commodity is fully visible to avoid partial data extraction.
